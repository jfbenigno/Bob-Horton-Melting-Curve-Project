# Bob-Horton-Melting-Curve-Project



Took reference curve from figure from https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/instance/382884/pdf/pnas00001-0109.pdf figure 3 


Made it into a CSV file using a digitalizer (https://automeris.io/wpd/?v=5_2)) 

Perplexity said to normalize values and asked to do it through chatGPT 
- Plot it using the following code in R, File name: PHI147X_melting_curve.R

Took Decipher plot and extracted CSV files 
Graph was off due to different units?
